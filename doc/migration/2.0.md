# 2.0 Release Notes

Version 2.0.0 of the Npgsql Entity Framework Core provider has been released and is available on nuget. This version works with [version 2.0.0 of Entity Framework Core](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/08/14/announcing-entity-framework-core-2-0/), and contains some new Npgsql features as well.

## New Features

Aside from general EF Core features new in 2.0.0, the Npgsql provider contains the following major new features:

* PostgreSQL array operation translation ([#120](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/issues/120)). While array properties have been supported since 1.1, operations on those arrays where client-evaluated. Version 2.0 will now translate array indexing, `.Contains()`, `.SequenceEquals()` and `.Length`. See the [mapping and translation docs](../mapping-and-translation.md) for more details.
* A retrying execution strategy ([#155](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/issues/155)), which will automatically retry operations on exceptions which are considered transient.
* PostgreSQL extensions are now included in scaffolded models ([#102](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/issues/102)).
* More LINQ operations are translated to SQL, and more database scenarios are scaffolded correctly (see [the docs](http://www.npgsql.org/efcore/mapping-and-translation.html)).

Here's the [full list of issues](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/milestone/6?closed=1). Please report any problems to https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL.

## Upgrading from 1.x

* Previously an Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL.Design nuget package existed alongside the main package. Its contents have been merged into the main Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL and no new version has been released.
* Specifying versions when specifying PostgreSQL extensions on your model is no longer supported - this was a very rarely-used feature which interfered with extension scaffolding.
